In this project, we implemented different neural network architectures to classify the Amazon Fine Food Reviews as either positive, negative, or neutral. The Amazon Fine Food Review Kaggle dataset, was evaluated on various machine learning model architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) with GloVe embeddings were implemented. We analyzed the impact of hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of layers/hidden layers, and batch size on the performance of the models, where the evaluation metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The study achieved an overall 91% accuracy rate on the held-out test dataset using a CNN and 85% using the LSTM. These results highlight the effectiveness of using neural network models in sentiment analysis, which is able to provide insights into hyperparameter selection on model performance.
